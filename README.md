# MPLS PRACTICE - SCHOOL PROJECT

This project demonstrates the operation of a basic MPLS network within an ISP core, utilizing OSPF as the IGP, an IBGP full-mesh setup between the Provider Edge (PE) routers, and EBGP connections between the Customer Edge (CE) routers. The topology consists of four routers (R1â€“R4) representing the ISP core and two routers (R5 and R6) representing customers in different autonomous systems. Follow along as I walk you through how it all works.

## IGP (OSPF) Configurtion

The provided OSPF configuration details how the ISP's core routers are set up to ensure inter-router connectivity and facilitate MPLS label switching operations.

```bash
 R1
 router ospf 1
 router-id 150.1.1.1
 network 150.1.1.1 0.0.0.0 area 0
 network 155.1.12.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 redistribute ospf 1
 ```

 ```bash
 R2
 router ospf 1
 router-id 150.1.2.2
 network 150.1.2.2 0.0.0.0 area 0
 network 155.1.12.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 network 155.1.23.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 ```
 
  ```bash
 R3

 network 155.1.23.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 network 155.1.34.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
 ```

  
  ```bash
